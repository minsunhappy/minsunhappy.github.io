I am a second-year masterâ€™s student at [KAIST Graduate School of Culture Technology](https://ct.kaist.ac.kr/), specializing in Computer Vision and HCI, under the guidance of Prof. Junyong Noh at the [Visual Media Lab](https://vml.kaist.ac.kr/).

**ðŸŒŸ My Vision**

I believe everyone has a story worth sharing, and my goal is to help **manifest those stories into reality**â€”whether through text, video, 3D, or other forms. My current focus is on making **video creation accessible to everyone**.

**ðŸ“š Research Interests**
- Automating video editing and cut generation
- Video generation using AI models
