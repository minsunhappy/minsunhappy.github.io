Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.


# About Me
I am a second-year master’s student at KAIST Graduate School of Culture Technology, specializing in computer vision and HCI, under the guidance of Prof. Joon-Young Noh at the Visual Media Lab.

# [icons] My Vision
I believe everyone has a story worth sharing, and my goal is to help manifest those stories into reality—whether through text, video, 3D, or other forms. My current focus is on making video creation accessible to everyone.
